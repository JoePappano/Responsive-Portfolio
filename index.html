            <p class="margins"> Hi! My name is Joe Pappano and welcome to my website! The page you're on is an about me
                section, so let me introduce myself:</p>
            <br>
            <p class="margins"> I grew up outside of Philadelphia, PA and studied at West Chester East High School. I
                was a multi-sport athlete and liked to spend time with friends outside on adventures. After graduation,
                I went to the University of Texas at Austin, where I majored in International Relations and Global
                Studies. After graduation from UT, I went to work for Total Quality Logistics, a Cincinnati-based
                logistics firm. Next, I worked for a tech start-up called OutboundEngine, then I got another job at an
                Austin-based logistics firm, called Arrive Logistics, and this is where I currently work. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="margins"> I love puzzles and building things, so a very close friend recommended I spend some
                time online learning how to code, I loved it and I decided to learn more. And now I am here at the
                University of Texas Coding Boot Camp writing this to you. </p>
